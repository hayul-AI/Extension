        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

        <p>At PixelConvert, your privacy is our foundational principle. We believe that your digital assets should remain private, which is why our service is built to process data locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>Local Browser Processing</h2>
        <p>Unlike most online conversion services, PixelConvert <strong>does not upload your images or documents to a remote server.</strong> All image conversions (HEIC, WEBP, PNG, JPG), compression, and metadata removal tasks are performed entirely within your web browser. Your original files never leave your computer or mobile device, ensuring maximum security and privacy.</p>

        <h2>OCR and Online Features</h2>
        <p>Our Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine also runs locally on your device. However, PixelConvert offers an optional "Check Grammar" feature to help polish your extracted text. If you explicitly choose to use this grammar check, only the <strong>extracted text snippet</strong> is sent to the LanguageTool public API for analysis. <strong>No images are ever sent</strong> during this process, and this step only occurs if you click the "Check Grammar" button.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection & Usage</h2>
        <p>We do not collect personal files or private data. Because our core tools run locally, we have no technical means to see, store, or monitor the images you process. We only collect personal information such as your name or email address if you voluntarily provide them through our contact form for support purposes.</p>

        <h2>Basic Analytics and Logs</h2>
        <p>We may collect non-identifiable technical data (such as browser type, device type, and page visit duration) to help us improve site performance. This data is aggregated and does not include any information about the contents of your processed files.</p>

        <h2>Advertising and Cookies</h2>
        <p>The website may use advertising services such as Google AdSense in the future. Advertising features will only be activated after approval, and this policy will be updated at that time to reflect any specific cookie or tracking usage associated with those services.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We utilize the following third-party services to enhance your experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LanguageTool API:</strong> For optional grammar and spell checking of extracted text (user-initiated).</li>
            <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> For consistent and modern typography.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Since we do not store your images on our servers, there is no image data to retain or delete. Any text extracted via OCR is held in your browser's temporary memory and is cleared once the tab is closed or the page is refreshed.</p>

        <h2>User Choices</h2>
        <p>You can manage your privacy by using your browser's built-in controls to block cookies or clear your cache. Because we do not require accounts, you have full control over your session at all times.</p>
